### Steps to Run in IDE
In order to run the program you will need the javafx sdk  you can watch the either
this video: (intellij) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ope4icw6bVk&t=101s or this 
video: (eclipse) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7OM-cMYWbQ or find a video of your
choice based on your editor. N.B Try not to use visual studio code... It sucks with
javafx and life will be much harder.
You will also need to install Scene Builder for javafx to build the scenes.
You can use this video to help set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Obxf6NjnbQ.
After you set up run App.java and you should be good :)
